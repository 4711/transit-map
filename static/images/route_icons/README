This folder should be populated by the scripts/gtfs-importer GTFS script. 
See rake project:update_settings_routes task

If you want to edit / save the route icons by hand, for each _distinct_ route_short_name field in the GTFS routes.txt file do the following
- create a .PNG icon, 20px x 20px with the vehicle icon and save it here
- make sure the route is present in static/js/config.js "routes" object

i.e. for a service route that has route_short_name "38" 
- a file named 38.png, 20x20 px should be present in this folder
- following definition should be present in config.js

    "s": {
      "icon": "static/images/route_icons/38.png",
      "route_short_name": "38",
      "route_color": "0178BC",
      "route_text_color": "FFFFFF"
    },

- use false for "icon" if you want the default Google Marker to be displayed
